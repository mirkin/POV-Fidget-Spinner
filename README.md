POV Fidget Spinner
==================

Persistence of vision fidget spinner using ATtiny 84a.

The kids asked for a Fidget Spinner when they were doing the rounds and I told
them to make their own. They did this with Lego, and then we 3D printed one and
used cheap 608 bearings. Any maker who gazes at these things as they slow down
can't help but imagine adding some LEDs.

A quick search showed some projects, mainly manufactured PCB kits. We wanted to
start from scratch and see where the journey took us.

We used a cheap ATtiny 84a programmed via Arduino IDE and an Uno. It took a few
hours to figure out how to do this but eventually we had an ATtiny blinking an
LED. https://github.com/mirkin/ATtiny84aSetup
